# PBO Extraction Implementation Summary

## Phase 1 Completed ✅

### Implementation Overview
Successfully restored PBO extraction functionality using the new HEMTT-based architecture while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing interfaces.

### Files Modified/Created

1. **Created: `crates/infra/extract/src/pbo_interface.rs`**
   - Defined `PboExtractor` trait for abstraction
   - Implemented `HemttPboExtractor` using `arma3-pbo` crate
   - Added proper handling for mod prefixes and mission directory structure
   - Normalized path separators for cross-platform compatibility

2. **Updated: `crates/infra/extract/src/processor.rs`**
   - Replaced TODO block (lines 133-143) with actual PBO extraction
   - Integrated HEMTT backend for extraction
   - Maintained existing post-extraction filtering logic
   - Preserved config.bin → config.cpp renaming (conversion pending Phase 2)

3. **Updated: `crates/infra/extract/Cargo.toml`**
   - Added `async-trait = "0.1"` dependency

4. **Updated: `crates/infra/extract/src/lib.rs`**
   - Exposed `pbo_interface` module

### Key Features Implemented

- **✅ Basic PBO Extraction**: Full extraction using HEMTT backend
- **✅ Filter Support**: Post-extraction filtering by file extensions
- **✅ Mod Support**: Preserves PBO prefix paths for mods
- **✅ Mission Support**: Creates proper directory structure for missions
- **✅ Path Normalization**: Converts backslashes to forward slashes
- **✅ Error Handling**: Proper error propagation maintained

### Critical Functionality Restored
- **PBO Extraction**: Core functionality now works
- **Test Coverage**: All extraction tests passing
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing interfaces preserved
- **Performance**: Extraction working with parallel processing

## Next Steps (Phase 2-4)

### Phase 2: Binary Config Conversion
- Implement config.bin → config.cpp conversion using HEMTT's debinarize
- Add conversion error handling
- Update tests for binary config scenarios

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Optimize filtering to extract only requested files
- Add streaming support for large PBOs
- Performance benchmarking

### Phase 4: Final Validation
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Performance comparison with original implementation
- Documentation updates

## Conclusion
The critical PBO extraction functionality has been successfully restored. The tool can now extract PBO files, which was the main blocking issue identified in the PR review. The implementation leverages the new HEMTT-based architecture while maintaining full compatibility with existing code.

# Progress

## Current Status

The ARMA3 Extractor library is in a mature state with all core functionality implemented and has undergone a significant improvement to remove external dependencies. Based on the codebase, the following components are complete and operational:

✅ PBO scanning system (src/scanner.rs)
✅ PBO processing and extraction (src/processor.rs)
✅ File-based database (src/file_db.rs)
✅ Metadata models (src/models.rs)
✅ Error handling (src/error.rs)
✅ High-level manager API (src/manager.rs)
✅ Example applications (examples/basic_usage.rs, test_extraction.rs)
✅ Self-contained design (no external database dependency)

## What Works

1. **Core Extraction Pipeline**: The full extraction pipeline from scanning to processing to database tracking is implemented and working well.
2. **Parallel Processing**: The system uses rayon for parallel extraction operations.
3. **Incremental Updates**: Only extracting PBOs that have changed or have different extension filters.
4. **Game Data and Mission Support**: Handling of both game data and mission PBOs with different processing strategies.
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with specific error types for different failure scenarios.
6. **File-Based Storage**: Tracking of extracted files and their metadata in a JSON file database.
7. **Configuration Options**: Flexible configuration options for controlling the extraction process.
8. **Self-Contained**: No external database dependencies, making the library more portable and easier to integrate.
9. **Reliable `config.cpp` Handling**: Correctly extracts `config.cpp` (renamed from `config.bin`) when `cpp` is included in the extension filter, thanks to the post-extraction filtering workaround in `PboProcessor`.

## Recent Accomplishments

1. **Removed External Database Dependency**: Successfully replaced the arma3_database dependency with a standalone file-based solution.
2. **File-Based Database**: Implemented a robust file-based database using JSON serialization for metadata storage.
3. **API Simplification**: Created a cleaner API for finding source PBOs for extracted files.
4. **Test Coverage**: Updated all tests to work with the new database implementation.
5. **Extension Order Handling**: Improved extension handling to properly manage extension order variations.
6. **`config.cpp` Extraction Fix**: Implemented a workaround in `PboProcessor` to reliably extract `config.cpp` by handling the `pbo_tools` filtering order quirk.
7. **Fixture Integration Tests**: Added specific integration tests using fixture PBOs to validate core extraction scenarios and edge cases.

## What's Left to Build

Potential areas for future improvement include:

1. **Progress Reporting**: More detailed progress reporting during extraction operations (potentially with a progress callback).
2. **Cancellation Support**: Better support for cancelling operations in progress.
3. **More Examples**: Additional example applications demonstrating specific use cases.
4. **Documentation**: Further documentation of the API and usage patterns.
5. **Benchmarking**: Performance benchmarks for measuring extraction speed.
6. **Cross-Platform Testing**: More thorough testing on different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).

## Known Issues

1. **Path Handling**: Path normalization between platforms can be tricky, especially with Windows vs. Unix paths.
2. **File Storage Size**: For very large mod collections, the JSON database file could become large.
3. **Memory Usage**: Handling very large extraction operations with many files.
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful recovery from certain types of extraction failures.
5. **Post-Extraction Filter Performance**: The secondary filtering pass in `PboProcessor` adds a small overhead, though likely negligible in most cases. Could be revisited if performance issues arise with extremely large numbers of files within PBOs.

## Project Evolution

The project shows signs of thoughtful evolution:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different components.
2. **Interface Stability**: Public API remains stable while internal implementation has changed.
3. **Error Handling Maturity**: Error types have evolved to cover a wide range of failure scenarios.
4. **Dependency Reduction**: Recent work has focused on reducing external dependencies for better portability.
5. **Testing Strategy**: The presence of unit and integration tests, including specific fixture tests, indicates a robust testing approach.
6. **Robustness**: Increased robustness in handling quirks and limitations of external tools (like `pbo_tools`).

## Next Milestones

Potential next milestones for the project could include:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize extraction and database operations for large mod collections.
2. **API Refinement**: Continue to refine the public API for better usability.
3. **Enhanced Reporting**: Implement more detailed reporting during extraction operations.
4. **Cross-Platform Improvements**: Ensure consistent behavior across different platforms.
5. **Additional File Type Support**: Expand support for more file types and extraction options.

## Decision Log

Recent key architectural decisions:

1. **File-Based Storage**: Using JSON files instead of SQLite for metadata storage.
2. **Database Schema Simplification**: Simplified the database schema to focus on core needs.
3. **Public vs. Private API**: Clear separation between public and private APIs.
4. **Extension Order Handling**: Sort extensions to ensure order doesn't affect extraction decisions.
5. **Path Normalization**: Consistent approach to handling path differences between platforms.
